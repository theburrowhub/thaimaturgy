Shafts of pale light pierce the canopy here and there, illuminating dancing dust motes.\n\nThe tracks are fresh—perhaps a day old at most. You notice broken twigs and crushed undergrowth, suggesting the goblins weren't trying to hide their passage. Either they're confident in their safety, or they were in a hurry.\n\nAhead, the path splits. The main goblin trail continues north, but you spot a thin column of smoke rising from somewhere to the east—perhaps a campfire.\n\nWhat do you do?\n- Continue following the main goblin trail north\n- Investigate the smoke to the east\n- Search the immediate area for more clues\n- Climb a tree to get a better vantage point",
